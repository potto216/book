# Course Setup Guides

Many of the Tock guides have specific hardware platforms they were developed for
with pre-configured kernels available to use on a board. However, the course
guides are generally designed to be able to run on other hardware, however, in
those cases there will not be a pre-configured kernel. These guides include the
instructions on how to setup various kernel features required for various
modules in the courses.
