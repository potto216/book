This tutorial introduces you to building a device using Tock, going from how the

individual applications.

## Tutorial Stages

1. [Kernel Startup](./boot.md): How the kernel starts running an initializes the
   OS.
2. [Application Development](./application.md): Writing a sensing application.
3. [Kernel Policies](./policies.md): Configuring the kernel to use per-process
