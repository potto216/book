## Thread Networking Tutorials

Tock provides two Thread networking tutorials:

- [Temperature Sensor Tutorial](./temperature-sensor/overview.md)
- [Encrypted Sensor Data Tutorial](./encrypted-sensor-data/overview.md)

Both tutorials introduce Thread networking in Tock in addition to a number of
other concepts. The
[temperature sensor tutorial](./temperature-sensor/overview.md) assumes no
familiarity with Tock and introduces the concepts surrounding syscalls,
callbacks, and interprocess communication. Conversely, the
[encrypted sensor data tutorial](./encrypted-sensor-data/overview.md) jumps
straight into setting up a Thread network in Tock and introduces how Tock and a
root of trust can provide enhanced security in IoT settings.
